# MachineLearning-Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of several common machine learning algorithms in Python.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
  - Normal Equation
  - Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
  - NumPy implementation
  - PyTorch with Autograd implementation
- Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network)
  
## Usage
Each algorithm has its own file with a class implementation and example usage. The implementations also include k-fold cross validation on a sample dataset. Results are plotted and analyzed.
See individual files for details on specific algorithms, datasets used, and cross validation results.
